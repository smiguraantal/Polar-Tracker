# Polar Tracker

## Overview

Polar Tracker is a Spring Boot application I created to save my workout data from the Polar API and store it in a personal database. 
The data is optimized for two types of workouts: running and cycling. 
The purpose of the application is to extract information from my workouts that the Polar Flow interface does not provide. 
After saving and storing the data, I can write custom queries and create unique statistics and analyses.
